  <h3>introduction </h3>
 Computer pioneers correctly predicted that programmers would want unlimited
amounts of fast memory, An economical solution to that desire is a memory hier-
archy, which takes advantage of locality and trade-offs in the cost-performance
of memory technologies. The principle oflocality, presented in the first chapter,
says that most programs do not all code or data uniformly. Locality occurs
in time (temporal faculty) and in space (spatial locality). This principle, plus the
guideline that for a given implementation technology and power budget smaller
hardware can be made faster, led to hierarchies based on memories of different
speeds and sizes. Figure 2.1 shows a multilevel memory hierarchy, including typ-
ical sizes and speeds of access.
Since fast memory is expensive, a memory hierarchy is organized into sevenal
bevels each smaller, faster, and more expensive per hyte than the next lower level,
which is farther from the processor. The goal is to provide a memory system with
cost per hyte almost as low as the cheapest level of memory and speed almost as
fast as the fastest level. In most cases (but not all), the data contained in a lower
level are a superset of the next higher level. This property, called the inclusion
property, is always required for the lowest level of the hierarchy, which consists of
main memory in the case of caches and disk memory in the case of virtual memory
